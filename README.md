This project is a motion detector using the camera of my personal computer.

- Language: Python
- Libraries: cv2, pandas, time, datetime, bokeh.plotting, bokeh.models

Application:

1. Run the application - the computer camera will trigger and will turn on.
2. Ideal situation is that no moving object at the time of the first run.
3. Camera will detect all motions passing the camera. A green rectangular shape will emphasize the motion.
4. "q" to quit the application.
5. This will generate data in a csv file.
6. The data captures are the start and end time the camera detected the motions.
7. It will plot the data to a graph for visual.
8. Working on .... hover effect in the graph to show the start and end time.
